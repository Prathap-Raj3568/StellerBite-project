# StellerBite-project

StellerBite is a RESTful food ordering platform I built using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. I implemented modular controllers for customers, restaurants, and admins, ensuring each role had clear functionality. I integrated Hibernate ORM for seamless CRUD operations and robust persistence. This project helped me strengthen my backend design skills, especially in building scalable, role-based systems.‚Äù
